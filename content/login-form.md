I am quite tired today. I don't really have any energy to finish the actual challenge
So, I decided to make a simple login form with HTML + CSS (Stylus). Stylus is one of my
favorite CSS preprocessor. It feels "Python-ic" to me. I am a Python programmer so I like
the similar things. Stylus is newer than SCSS and LESS so it get less (no pun intended) adoption.
Tailwind and CSS-in-JS are more popular now. I use WindiCSS, which is based on Tailwind, for this 100 days blog.

I hope I will have energy to do another challenge tomorrow. I need to read more about Responsive design. This login form looks weird for me.
