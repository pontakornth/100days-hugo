This time, I use React because I want to know about managing data in React. It's difficult.
The styling methods is `twin.macro` and `goober`. I had to argue with TypeScript about typing.
But, I think it worths knowing. Because, I will need to deal with custome type in the future.

I don't like about the code and the design. I am a terrible designer. It looks kinda dumb.
The code is too messy. I think I duplicate a lot of styling just to get the job done. I 
need to refactor it into components or resuable styles. The <code class="language-ts">App</code>
is messy. It's big. I should try to serperate form into another component. But, I don't know how
to do that without passing numerous of props. I may need to do it.


Tomorrow, I might try to refactor and add a functionality of it.
