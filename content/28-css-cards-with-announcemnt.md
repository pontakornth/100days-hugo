This is not much progress since I have lots of study and works to do. I have some important
annoucement about 100 days of code challenge.<!--more-->


I have to postpone updating until the further notice. It is near the final examination and I
cannot sacrifice my exam score to have time for this challenge. If I have some time to
spare, I would need to upload some incomplete project to the 100 day blog. It is hard.
Things are not always in your favor or against your favor. I hope the reader understand what
I have to do right now.


Once I get back to the challenge, I promise that it will be more interesting that low effort CSS
art. I plan to do some Discord bot, Kaminari and some web app. Mini chat app will get rework because
the design is terrible.
