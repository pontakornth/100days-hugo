This is a one step of the bigger project, the chat app. I never actually develop any chat
app before. This is one of the new project I think I could get more learning here.<!--more-->


To be frank, I played Minecraft for a bit too long today and did not consider coding at that
moment. So I came up with a project that I can do one both CodePen and Github. The design is
in the codepen because I find Codepen is easier to setup designing. The actual chap application
will be done on my Github because it is hard to maintain a chat app in codepen.


Flex box is really useful for setting the chat UI. I need to specify how components should flow
and it will do the alignment for me. If I did this project earlier before flex box, I would 
need a lot of hack to make chat UI work. I haven't decide about stack I will use yet. But,
Firebase is definitely going to be used because I don't want to setup everything myself.
