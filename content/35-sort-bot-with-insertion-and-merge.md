I was a bit "dead inside" for 2 days. I am better now. I decided that I should port remaining algorithms
to the algorithm bot before searching will be implemented.<!--more-->


The code mainly from porting JavaScript to Python. Several methods are changed. The most mysterious part
is the None type out of nowhere. I don't know if some animation is missing or not. But, I think there is
no missing animation as the list is sorted correctly.


Also, I think I will try the project that involves database or some kind of backend to widen my skill.
