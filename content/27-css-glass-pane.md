Another CSS art today. Today, I have some assignments to do so I cannot do full hour code. The code
in the assignment does not count. It is similar to the working rule in 100 days of code. I use
transperancy ant linear gradient to make CSS glass pane.<!--more-->


I discover that it is possible to use linear gradient with transperancy. I use Stylus as always to 
save some keystrokes. The iteration and interpolation are problems. The error message is not descriptive enough. I cannot find the correct cause without Googling stuff.
I think it may come with the dynamic nature. Other language such as Ruby suffer from this as
well. The static language does not fit the styling job. Try to imagine styling web with static
preprocessor.


It's not realistic but I am pround of it.
