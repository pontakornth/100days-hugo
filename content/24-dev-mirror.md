This is a project that is similar to the cat project I had done before. It is for praticing
consistently without worrying about learning too many things at time. Just like the cat project
, I use Vite + WindiCSS as a framework.<!--more-->


I am pretty sure that this project will gain more benefit from stale-while-revalidating because
the articles are more static than random cat images. It means I can cache content a bit longer.
If there is no article, the web wouldn't need to re-request it at all. I will try to add more 
feature to the project. All link will be direct at the article in the original website so they
can gain some views.
