This is another CSS art that I make for this challenge. I use the position again to manipulate
location of element to center the sun and hide the lower half of the sun. But in this CSS art
I use <code class="language-css">radial-gradient</code> to simulate the lighting.<!--more-->


Radial gradient is the CSS property that use to setup the gradient in ellipse radial. You need to
specify the center of the gradient and colors to stop. I don't have much content to explain as
the MDN documentation is probably do this better.
