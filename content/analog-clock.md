Well, I already written a analog clock using Python in programming class before.
But, I think as a frontend developer. I should write it in Javascript too.
The clock was drawn on the canvas element. It works on Firefox but I didn't test it on
<!--more-->
Chrome or Edge. I think it should work fine. The clock updates every second. I use `setTimeout` to accomplish this. I know about `requestAnimationFrame` but I don't think it would be suitable for this job.

I wish I can do more than that. I should do more challenging task. But I think that's a great start. Because when you need to go far, the first step is important. You will get burned out if you don't get a break. I think I can do more challenges until the final exam. At that point, I should focus on studying. I will try to learn new things anyway.
