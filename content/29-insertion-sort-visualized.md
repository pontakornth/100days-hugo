I am back now. After tiring examination, the exam finished me before I finish the exam. So, I think
I might try something I familiar but with a twist.<!--more-->


During the time I prepared for an exam, I found a YouTube video featuring sort algorithm sounded. I am 
interested to create one too. I use insertion sort because it "looks" sorted when using with the animation. The algorithm itself is not a good idea for sorting large amount of data because the complexity is O(n^2). I heard that it is still suitable for small array.


I used good old canvas API as before. I somehow cannot draw thing inside a loop of sorting. I made the 
sort function push a copy and position to the queue. There is no sound now.


I am satisfied that I can create this. I wish to add more algorithm, add sound, make it replayable and responsive.
