This is the end of the holiday . I think I spend too much time on the RPG Maker project.
In fact, I always want to create an RPG game since childhood. Final Fantasy 6 is my
first game. It impressed me. Many people said that it is one of the best game ever.
Today, I am a programmer. Now I can at least create something about it.<!--more-->


I use HTML and CSS because they are technologies that I am familiar with. I learned
that I can use <code class="language-css">border-image-source</code> to create a border
with gradient just like how RPG Maker can do it. The <code class="language-css">
repeating-linear-gradient</code> is used to make the stripe background. I am still find
a way to properly do test-driven development on the Mini Chat App. Because I cannot mock 
the Firebase thing, I do not count it as a part of the challenge. Using RPG Maker is not
counted too. Unless, I write some script myself. But, it already has more than enough
things to use.
